## Step-by-Step Approach to Prepare for AI-900

### 1. Explore Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn’s **"AI Fundamentals"** learning paths are tailored to the exam objectives and are a must-have resource. Here's how I used them:
- Completed the modules to cover all exam topics.
- Experimented with hands-on labs, using Azure services like **Computer Vision**, **Form Recognizer**, and **Azure Machine Learning** to reinforce theoretical knowledge.
- Used the **knowledge checks** at the end of each module to identify gaps and review key concepts.

### 2. Watch John Savill’s Videos (YouTube)
John Savill’s free YouTube videos are a goldmine for getting clarity on complex topics.
- I watched the videos in sequence to ensure I had a structured understanding.
- Took detailed notes on key areas such as **Generative AI**, **machine learning models**, and **cognitive services**.
- Revisited tricky concepts multiple times to solidify my understanding.

These videos simplified intricate concepts and made AI fundamentals much more accessible.

### 3. Take the Microsoft Learn Practice Test
The free practice test on Microsoft Learn is an invaluable tool for assessing your readiness:
- I used it to identify and address knowledge gaps and determine which topics needed more focus.
- Reviewed incorrect answers and revisited related modules to strengthen weak areas.
- Took the test multiple times to build confidence and become familiar with the exam format.

### 4. Scott Duffy’s Udemy Course (Optional)
If you prefer more structured learning, Scott Duffy’s Udemy course is an excellent supplement:
- Provides in-depth explanations of topics and extra quizzes to test your knowledge.
- The demos of Azure services helped me gain hands-on experience, which made the theoretical content more relatable.

## Exam Day Tips
- **Stay Calm**- A relaxed mind performs better under pressure. Trust your preparation.
- **Pay Extra Attention to Workload and Model Questions**- Carefully read questions to determine if they are asking about an **AI workload** (e.g., vision, speech, decision-making) or a specific **model type** (e.g., classification, regression). Misinterpreting these can lead to incorrect answers.
- **Manage Your Time**- Don’t dwell on tricky questions—flag them and return later if needed.

## Benefits of This Approach
- **Cost-Effective**- Most resources, like John Savill’s videos, Microsoft Learn, and the practice exams, are free.
- **Efficient**- Focuses on the most relevant content, including concepts, key workloads, and hands-on practice.
- **Beginner-Friendly**- No prior experience in AI or Azure is needed, making it accessible to everyone.

## Additional Resources to Enhance Learning
While the above steps can be primary approach, along with this also try to explore additional resources to deepen the understanding:
- **Azure Free Tier**-Try creating a free Azure account to practice using the services mentioned in the exam.
- **Community Forums**- Joining forums like the Microsoft Tech Community allowed me to clarify doubts and learn from others’ experiences.
